# Push_buttton_counter

This project simulates a digital counter using a push button and Arduino. Each press of the button increases a count, which is displayed on the Serial Monitor. This basic embedded system demonstrates input detection, debouncing, and simple logic control.

## How It Works:
When the button is pressed, a counter value increments by 1.
The current count is printed in the Serial Monitor.
Can be extended to display on LCD, 7-segment, or OLED.

## Components Used:

Arduino Uno
Push Button
10kÎ© Resistor (pull-down resistor)
Breadboard
Jumper Wires

## Project Title: Push Button Counter

This project uses an Arduino to count the number of times a push button is pressed. Each button press increases a counter, and the value is displayed on the Serial Monitor or an LCD. It's a simple example of digital input reading and debouncing in embedded systems.
